@article{Hirose2004,
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the magnetic field structure found in a set of four general relativistic three-dimensional MHD simulations of accreting tori in the Kerr metric with different black hole spins. Among the properties analyzed are the field strength as a function of position and black hole spin, the shapes of field lines, the degree to which they connect different regions, and their degree of tangling. Strong magnetic field is found toward small radii, and field strength increases with black hole spin. In the main disk body, inner torus, and corona the field is primarily toroidal. Most field lines passing through a given radius in these regions wander through a narrow radial range, suggesting an overall tightly wound spiral structure. In the main disk body and inner torus sharp field-line bends on small spatial scales are superposed on the spirals, but the field lines are much smoother in the corona. The magnetic field in the plunging region is also comparatively smooth, being stretched out radially by the infalling gas. The magnetic field in the axial funnel resembles a split monopole, but with evidence of frame dragging of the field lines near the poles of the black hole. We investigate prior speculations about the structure of the magnetic fields and discuss how frequently certain configurations are seen in the simulations. For example, coronal loops are very rare, and field lines connecting high latitudes on the event horizon to the disk are not found at all. Almost the entire system is matter-dominated the only force-free regions are in the axial funnel. We also analyze the distribution of current density, with a view toward identifying possible locations of magnetic energy dissipation. Regions of high current density are concentrated toward the inner torus and plunging region. Dissipation inside the marginally stable orbit may provide a new source of energy for radiation, supplementing the dissipation associated with torques in the stably orbiting disk body.},

We performed a series of 2D runs for black holes with specific angular momentum, a, from 0.1 to 0.9 and for a monopole magnetic field assuming axisymmetry. In the inner region of the wind, the solution quickly settles to a steady state with an outgoing Poynting flux. In all cases the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines is almost half the angular velocity of the black hole.

abstract = {Recently it has been observed that the scaling of jet power with black hole spin in Galactic X-ray binaries is consistent with the predictions of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet model. These observations motivate us to revisit the BZ model using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized jets from accreting (h/r {\tilde} 0.3), spinning (0 {\lt} a_{*} {\lt} 0.98) black holes. We have three main results. First, we quantify the discrepancies between the BZ jet power and our simulations: assuming maximum efficiency and uniform fields on the horizon leads to an {\tilde}10 per cent overestimate of jet power, while ignoring the accretion disc leads to a further {\tilde}50 per cent overestimate. Simply reducing the standard BZ jet power prediction by 60 per cent gives a good fit to our simulation data. Our second result is to show that the membrane formulation of the BZ model correctly describes the physics underlying simulated jets: torques, dissipation and electromagnetic fields on the horizon. This provides intuitive yet rigorous pictures for the black hole energy extraction process. Third, we compute the effective resistance of the load region and show that the load and the black hole achieve near perfect impedance matching. Taken together, these results increase our confidence in the BZ model as the correct description of jets observed from astrophysical black holes.},

abstract = {We consider a two-parameter family of cylindrical force-free equilibria, modeled to match numerical simulations of relativistic force-free jets. We study the linear stability of these equilibria, assuming a rigid impenetrable wall at the outer cylindrical radius R_{j} . Equilibria in which the Lorentz factor {$\gamma$}(R) increases monotonically with increasing radius R are found to be stable. On the other hand, equilibria in which {$\gamma$}(R) reaches a maximum value at an intermediate radius and then declines to a smaller value {$\gamma$}_{ j } at R_{j} are unstable. A feature of these unstable equilibria is that poloidal field line curvature plays a prominent role in maintaining transverse force balance. The most rapidly growing mode is an m = 1 kink instability which has a growth rate \$\sim${}(0.4/{$\gamma$}_{ j })(c/R_{j} ). The e-folding length of the equivalent convected instability is \$\sim${}2.5{$\gamma$}_{ j } R_{j} . For a typical jet with an opening angle {\thetas}_{ j } \$\sim${} few/{$\gamma$}_{ j }, the mode amplitude grows only weakly with increasing distance from the base of the jet. The growth is much slower than one might expect from a naive application of the Kruskal-Shafranov stability criterion.},

abstract = {We introduce a multipolar scheme for describing the structure of stationary, axisymmetric, force-free black hole magnetospheres in the `3+1' formalism. We focus here on Schwarzschild space-time, giving a complete classification of the separable solutions of the stream equation. We show a transparent term-by-term analogy of our solutions with the familiar multipoles of flat-space electrodynamics. We discuss electrodynamic processes around disc-fed black holes in which our solutions find natural applications: (i) `interior' solutions in studies of the Blandford-Znajek process of extracting the rotational energy of holes, and of the formation of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei and `microquasars' (ii) `exterior' solutions in studies of accretion disc dynamos, disc-driven winds and jets. On the strength of existing numerical studies, we argue that the poloidal field structures found here are also expected to hold with good accuracy for rotating black holes, except for the cases of the maximum possible rotation rates. We show that the closed-loop exterior solutions found here are not in contradiction with the Macdonald-Thorne theorem, as these solutions, which diverge logarithmically on the horizon of the hole H, only apply to those regions that exclude H.},

In this paper, in order to see how an electric current affects the Meissner-like effect, we study a force-free electromagnetic system in a static and spherically symmetric extreme black hole space-time. By assuming that the rotational angular velocity of the magnetic field is very small, we construct a perturbative solution for the Grad-Shafranov equation, which is the basic equation to determine a stationary, axisymmetric electromagnetic field with a force-free electric current. Our perturbation analysis reveals that, if an electric current exists, higher multipole components may be superposed upon the monopole component on the event horizon, even if the black hole is extreme.},

However, it is also true that for a long time its physics was not well understood, as evidenced by the controversy that surrounded it since 1990s. Thanks to the efforts of many theorists during the last decade the state of affairs is gradually improving. In this lecture I attempt to explain the key ingredients of this process in more or less systematic, rigorous, and at the same time relatively simple fashion. A particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between the Blandford-Znajek and Penrose processes. To this purpose I formulate the notion of energy counter flow. The concept of horizon membrane is replaced with the concept of vacuum as an electromagnetically active medium. The effect of negative phase velocity of electromagnetic waves in the black hole ergosphere is also discussed.},

However, recent work suggests that the effects of general relativity are in fact of vital importance and that realistic pulsar magnetic fields may have a significant nondipolar component. We introduce a general analytical method for studying the axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere of a slowly-rotating star of arbitrary magnetic field, mass, radius and moment of inertia, including all the effects of general relativity. We confirm that spacelike current is generically present in the polar caps (suggesting a pair production region), irrespective of the stellar magnetic field. We show that general relativity introduces a $\sim$60% correction to the formula for the dipolar component of the surface magnetic field inferred from spindown. Finally, we show that the location and size of the polar caps can be modified dramatically by even modestly strong higher moments. This can affect emission processes occurring near the star and may explain the decreased beam size of millisecond pulsars.},

abstract = {Blandford-Znajek process, the steady electromagnetic energy extraction from a rotating black hole (BH), is widely believed to work for driving relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts and Galactic microquasars, although it is still under debate how the Poynting flux is causally produced and how the rotational energy of the BH is reduced. We generically discuss the Kerr BH magnetosphere filled with a collisionless plasma screening the electric field along the magnetic field, extending the arguments of Komissarov and our previous paper, and propose a new picture for resolving the issues. For the magnetic field lines threading the equatorial plane in the ergosphere, we find that the inflow of particles with negative energy as measured in the coordinate basis is generated near that plane as a feedback from the Poynting flux production, which appears to be a similar process to the mechanical Penrose process. For the field lines threading the event horizon, we first show that the concept of the steady inflow of negative electromagnetic energy is not physically essential, partly because the sign of the electromagnetic energy density depends on the coordinates. Then we build an analytical toy model of a time-dependent process both in the Boyer-Lindquist and Kerr-Schild coordinate systems in which the force-free plasma injected continuously is filling a vacuum, and suggest that the structure of the steady outward Poynting flux is causally constructed by the displacement current and the cross-field current at the in-going boundary between the plasma and the vacuum. In the steady state, the Poynting flux is maintained without any electromagnetic source.},

@article{McKinney2007b,
abstract = {In paper I, we showed that time-dependent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical models of accretion disks, although being highly turbulent, have surprisingly simple electromagnetic properties. In particular, the toroidal current density in the disk takes the form $dI_\phi/dr \propto r^{-5/4}$. Guided by this simplicity, we use a time-dependent general relativistic force-free electrodynamics (GRFFE) code to study an idealized problem in which the accretion disk is replaced by an infinitely thin rotating equatorial current sheet. We consider both an $r^{-5/4}$ current profile and an $r^{-1}$ profile, the latter corresponding to the paraboloidal model of Blandford & Znajek (1977). The force-free magnetosphere we obtain with the $r^{-5/4}$ current sheet matches remarkably well to the Poynting-dominated jet seen in GRMHD numerical models. By comparing to the non-rotating force-free model studied in paper I, rotation is seen to lead to mild decollimation of the jet suggesting that hoop-stress forces nearly cancel centrifugal forces. In order to study the process that generates the corona and disk wind and destroys the ordered field in the corona in GRMHD numerical models, the force-free field with the $r^{-5/4}$ current distribution is embedded in an accretion disk and followed in a GRMHD simulation. Reconnection and magnetic stresses contribute to a magnetized, thermal wind without the aid of an ordered field threading the disk.},

abstract = {We performed simulations of collapsars with different Kerr parameters of a = 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 0.95. It was shown that a more rapidly rotating black hole is driving a more energetic jet. No jet is seen for the case of the Schwartzschild black-hole case, while the total energy of the jet is as large as 1050erg for a rapidly rotating Kerr black-hole case (a = 0.95). In order to explain the high luminosity of a gamma-ray burst, it is concluded that a rapidly rotating black hole is favored (`faster is better'). We also find that in the case of a = 0.95, (i) a stagnation region is clearly found in the jet region, (ii) ordered poloidal field lines are seen in the jet, (iii) the jet region is surrounded by a `wall-like' structure that has a higher pressure than the jet region, and contains strong vertical magnetic fields, and (iv) the jet is initiated by an outgoing Poynting flux from the outer horizon of the black hole (Blandford-Znajek effect). The bulk Lorentz factor of the jet is still on the order of unity. However, the energy density of electro-magnetic fields is dominated by the one of rest-mass in the jet. It can be expected that a relativistic jet will be seen if we perform a simulation for a longer time scale (of the order of 10-100 s).},

We set up a careful analysis of the perturbative definition of the Blandford-Znajek monopole, showing in particular that the regime in which it is defined allows to use the technique of matched asymptotic expansions. Our conclusion is that the Blandford-Znajek monopole, as it is defined, is not consistent with demanding physically reasonable boundary conditions far away from the event horizon.

It is found that the numerical solution evolves towards a stable steady-state solution which is very close to the corresponding force-free solution found by Blandford & Znajek. Contrary to the recent claims, the particle inertia does not become dynamically important near the event horizon and the force-free approximation provides a proper framework for magnetically dominated magnetospheres of black holes. For the first time, our numerical simulations show the development of an ultrarelativistic particle wind from a rotating black hole. However, the flow remains Poynting-dominated all the way up to the fast critical point. This suggests that the details of the so-called `astrophysical load', where the electromagnetic energy is transferred to particles, may have no effect on the efficiency of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.},

Boundary conditions satisfied by a force-free black-hole magnetosphere are derived, showing that the hole behaves like an imperfectly conducting rotating body.

abstract = {Radio loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are on average 1000 times brighter in the radio band compared to radio quiet AGNs. We investigate whether this radio loud/quiet dichotomy can be due to differences in the spin of the central black holes (BHs) that power the radio-emitting jets. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we construct steady state axisymmetric numerical models for a wide range of BH spins (dimensionless spin parameter 0.1 {\lt}= a {\lt}= 0.9999) and a variety of jet geometries. We assume that the total magnetic flux through the BH horizon at radius r _{H}(a) is held constant. If the BH is surrounded by a thin accretion disk, we find that the total BH power output depends approximately quadratically on the angular frequency of the hole, P vprop {$\Omega$}^{2} _{H} vprop (a/r _{H})^{2}. We conclude that, in this scenario, differences in the BH spin can produce power variations of only a few tens at most. However, if the disk is thick such that the jet subtends a narrow solid angle around the polar axis, then the power dependence becomes much steeper, P vprop {$\Omega$}^{4} _{H} or even vprop{$\Omega$}^{6} _{H}. Power variations of 1000 are then possible for realistic BH spin distributions. We derive an analytic solution that accurately reproduces the steeper scaling of jet power with {$\Omega$}_{H} and we provide a numerical fitting formula that reproduces all our simulation results. We discuss other physical effects that might contribute to the observed radio loud/quiet dichotomy of AGNs.},

In this paper, two-dimensional force-free solutions of the stream equation are numerically obtained in a general relativistic context (3+1 formalism on Kerr geometry). We apply the numerical method of finite elements. In this approach, the regularity conditions along the light surfaces are automatically satisfied. After an iterative adjustment of the poloidal current distribution and the shape of the jet boundary, we find magnetic field configurations without kinks at the outer light surface. The solutions extend from the inner light surface of the Kerr black hole to the asymptotic regime of a cylindrically collimated jet with a finite radius. Different magnetic flux distributions along the disk surface were investigated. There is strong evidence for a hollow jet structure.},

abstract = {One of the mechanisms widely considered for driving relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei, Galactic microquasars and gamma-ray bursts is the electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of a central black hole, i.e. the Blandford-Znajek process, although the origin of the electromotive force in this process is still under debate. We study this process as the steady unipolar induction in the Kerr black hole magnetosphere filled with a collisionless plasma screening the electric field (the D field) along the magnetic field (the B field), i.e. D {\textperiodcentered} B = 0. We extend the formulations and arguments made by Komissarov, and generally show that the origin of the electromotive force is ascribed to the ergosphere. It is explicitly shown that open magnetic field lines penetrating the ergosphere have a region where the D field is stronger than the B field in the ergosphere, and it keeps driving the poloidal currents and generating the electromotive force and the outward Poynting flux. The range of the possible value of the so-called angular velocity of the magnetic field line $\Omega$F is deduced for the field lines threading the equatorial plane in the ergosphere. We briefly discuss the relation between our conclusion and the ideal magnetohydrodynamic condition.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations combined with simple analytical arguments are used to reach a number of important conclusions on the nature of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. We show that, just like in the Penrose mechanism and in the MHD models of Punsly and Coroniti, the key role in this mechanism is played by the black hole ergosphere. The poloidal currents are driven by the gravitationally induced electric field which cannot be screened within the ergosphere by any static distribution of the electric charge of locally created pair plasma. Contrary to what is expected in the Membrane paradigm, the energy and angular momentum are extracted not only along the magnetic field lines penetrating the event horizon but along all field lines penetrating the ergosphere. In dipolar magnetic configurations symmetric relative to the equatorial plane the force-free approximation breaks down within the ergosphere where a strong current sheet develops along the equatorial plane. This current sheet supplies energy and angular momentum at infinity to the surrounding force-free magnetosphere. The Blandford-Znajek monopole solution is found to be asymptotically stable and causal. The so-called horizon boundary condition of Znajek is shown to be a regularity condition at fast critical surface.},

abstract = {The formation and large-scale propagation of Poynting-dominated jets produced by accreting, rapidly rotating black hole systems are studied by numerically integrating the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion to follow the self-consistent interaction between accretion discs and black holes. This study extends previous similar work by studying jets till t\$\sim${} 10^{4}GM/c^{3} out to r\$\sim${} 10^{4}GM/c^{2}, by which the jet is superfast magnetosonic and moves at a lab-frame bulk Lorentz factor of {$\Gamma$}\$\sim${} 10 with a maximum terminal Lorentz factor of {$\Gamma$}_{&infin;}{\lt}\$\sim${} 10^{3}. The radial structure of the Poynting-dominated jet is piece-wise self-similar, and fits to flow quantities along the field line are provided. Beyond the Alfv{{\'{e}}}n surface at r\$\sim${} 10-100GM/c^{2}, the jet becomes marginally unstable to (at least) current-driven instabilities. Such instabilities drive shocks in the jet that limit the efficiency of magnetic acceleration and collimation. These instabilities also induce jet substructure with 3 {\lt}\$\sim${}{$\Gamma$}{\lt}\$\sim${} 15. The jet is shown to only marginally satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for kink instability, so this may explain how astrophysical jets can extend to large distances without completely disrupting. At large distance, the jet angular structure is Gaussian-like (or uniform within the core with sharp exponential wings) with a half-opening angle of \$\sim${}5{\deg} and there is an extended component out to \$\sim${} 27{\deg}. Unlike in some hydrodynamic simulations, the environment is found to play a negligible role in jet structure, acceleration, and collimation as long as the ambient pressure of the surrounding medium is small compared to the magnetic pressure in the jet.},

@book{Blandford2002,
abstract = {The extreme hypothesis that essentially all types of ultrarelativistic outflow -- specifically AGN jets, pulsar wind nebulae and GRB --are electromagnetic, rather than gas dynamical, phenomena is considered. Electromagnetic flows are naturally anisotropic and self-collimating so as to produce jet-like features. The relativistic force-free description of these flows, which is simpler than the relativistic MHD description, is explained. It is suggested that the magnetic field associated with AGN jets and GRB is quite extensively distributed in latitude, without necessarily increasing by much the total power. It is also proposed that the observed emission from these sources traces out regions of high current density where global instabilities drive a turbulence spectrum that is ultimately responsible for the particle acceleration and the synchrotron, inverse Compton and synchro-Compton emission. The direct extraction of spin energy from a black hole is re-examined and an electromagnetic model of GRB explosions is developed. It is also suggested that some GRB ``lighthouses'' be identified with accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star to form a black hole in a binary system.},

abstract = {In the case involving particles, the necessary and sufficient condition for the Penrose process to extract energy from a rotating black hole is absorption of particles with negative energies and angular momenta. No torque at the black-hole horizon occurs. In this article we consider the case of arbitrary fields or matter described by an unspecified, general energy-momentum tensor T$\mu$$\nu$ and show that the necessary and sufficient condition for extraction of a black hole's rotational energy is analogous to that in the mechanical Penrose process: absorption of negative energy and negative angular momentum. We also show that a necessary condition for the Penrose process to occur is for the Noether current (the conserved energy-momentum density vector) to be spacelike or past directed (timelike or null) on some part of the horizon. In the particle case, our general criterion for the occurrence of a Penrose process reproduces the standard result. In the case of relativistic jet-producing "magnetically arrested disks," we show that the negative energy and angular-momentum absorption condition is obeyed when the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is at work, and hence the high energy extraction efficiency up to ˜300% found in recent numerical simulations of such accretion flows results from tapping the black hole's rotational energy through the Penrose process. We show how black-hole rotational energy extraction works in this case by describing the Penrose process in terms of the Noether current.},

@article{Alic2012,
abstract = {We provide additional information on our recent study of the electromagnetic emission produced during the inspiral and merger of supermassive black holes when these are immersed in a force-free plasma threaded by a uniform magnetic field. As anticipated in a recent letter, our results show that although a dual-jet structure is present, the associated luminosity is \$\sim${}100 times smaller than the total one, which is predominantly quadrupolar. Here we discuss the details of our implementation of the equations in which the force-free condition is not implemented at a discrete level, but rather obtained via a damping scheme which drives the solution to satisfy the correct condition. We show that this is important for a correct and accurate description of the current sheets that can develop in the course of the simulation. We also study in greater detail the three-dimensional charge distribution produced as a consequence of the inspiral and show that during the inspiral it possesses a complex but ordered structure which traces the motion of the two black holes. Finally, we provide quantitative estimates of the scaling of the electromagnetic emission with frequency, with the diffused part having a dependence that is the same as the gravitational-wave one and that scales as L ^{non-coll} _{EM} {\ap} {$\Omega$}^{10/3-8/3}, while the collimated one scales as L ^{coll} _{EM} {\ap} {$\Omega$}^{5/3-6/3}, thus with a steeper dependence than previously estimated. We discuss the impact of these results on the potential detectability of dual jets from supermassive black holes and the steps necessary for more accurate estimates.},

abstract = {The electromagnetic model (EMM) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and a contrast of its main properties and predictions with the hydrodynamic fireball model (FBM) and its magnetohydrodynamical extension are described. The EMM assumes that rotational energy of a relativistic, stellar-mass central source (black hole accretion disk system or fast rotating neutron star) is converted into magnetic energy through a unipolar dynamo mechanism, propagated to large distances in the form of relativistic, subsonic, Poynting flux-dominated wind and is dissipated directly into emitting particles through current-driven instabilities. Thus, there is no conversion back and forth between internal and bulk energies as in the case of the fireball model. Collimating effects of magnetic hoop stresses lead to strongly non-spherical expansion and formation of jets. Long and short GRBs may develop in a qualitatively similar way, except that in the case of long burst ejecta expansion has a relatively short, non-relativistic, strongly dissipative stage inside the star. EMMs and FBMs (as well as strongly and weakly magnetized fireballs) lead to different early afterglow dynamics, before deceleration time. Finally, the models are discussed in view of latest observational data in the Swift era. },

abstract = {Blandford-Znajek mechanism, by which the rotational energy of a black hole is extracted through electromagnetic fields, is one of the promising candidates as an essential process of the central engine of active compact objects such as Gamma-Ray Bursts. The only known analytical solution of this mechanism is the perturbative monopole solution for Kerr parameter a up to the second order terms. In order to apply Blandford-Znajek mechanism to rapidly rotating black holes, we try to obtain the perturbation solution up to the fourth order. As a result, we find that the fourth order terms of the vector potential diverge at infinity, which implies that the perturbation approach breaks down at large distance from the black hole. Although there are some uncertainties about the solution due to the unknown boundary condition at infinity for the fourth order terms, we can derive the evaluation of the total energy flux extracted from the black hole up to fourth order of a without any ambiguity. Further more, from the comparison between the numerical solution that is valid for 0<a<1 and the fourth order solution, we find that the fourth order solution reproduces the numerical result better than the second order solution. At the same time, since the fourth order solution does not match well with numerical result at large a, we conclude that more higher order terms are required to reproduce the numerical result.},

The basic formulation for the stability analysis of rotating force-free fields in Kerr geometry is provided. Then, for practical use of the analytical method, the stationary configuration is assumed to be cylindrical, and we treat the long-wave mode perturbations excited at large distances from the central black hole, where the strength of gravity becomes negligibly small.

Both the angular velocity $\Omega$ of magnetic field lines, the toroidal magnetic field $B^\phi$ and the total electric current $I$ are self-consistently specified according to our method. As an example, stationary axisymmetric and force-free jet models around rotating black holes are self-consistently constructed according to the method we proposed. This jet solution distinguishes itself from prior known analytic solutions in that it is highly collimated and asymptotically approaches a magnetic cylinder. This jet solution is helically twisted, since toroidal magnetic field is generated when the black hole spin is taken into account. For a given magnetic flux threading the black hole, the jet power and energy extraction rate of the collimated jet are compared with previous solutions. We find that our new solution agrees better with current state-of-the-art numerical simulation results. Some interesting properties of the collimated jet and effects of field line rotation on the jet stability are also briefly discussed.},

In this Letter we argue that conductivity dramatically changes the properties of axisymmetric electromagnetic solutions - even for a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, the magnetic field is pulled inside the event horizon. Moreover, the conditions resulting in an outgoing Poynting flux in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism exist not on the event horizon but everywhere within the black hole ergosphere. Thus, the `Meissner effect' is unlikely to be of interest in the astrophysics of black holes, at least not in the way this has been suggested so far. These conclusions are supported by the results of time-dependent numerical simulations that used three different computer codes. The test problems involve black holes with the rotation parameter ranging from a = 0.999 to a = 1. The pure electrodynamic simulations deal with the structure of conductive magnetospheres of black holes placed in a uniform-at-infinity magnetic field (Wald's problem) and the magnetohydrodynamic simulations are used to study the magnetospheres arising in the problem of disc accretion. },

Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field. The present concepts are applied to a model of an active galactic nucleus containing a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk.},

We show how and where longitudinal electric fields and toroidal magnetic fields are generated by the rotation, whereas they vanish everywhere for radial flow in a split monopole magnetic field in a Schwarzschild black hole. Outgoing electromagnetic power in a steady state is calculated by applying the WKB method to the perturbation equations for a small spin parameter. In our model, the luminosity has a peak in the vicinity of the black hole, but is damped toward the event horizon and infinity. The power at the peak is of the same order as that in the Blandford--Znajek process, although the physical mechanism is different.},

The method is based on a flux-conservative formalism for MHD and its force-free limit, and a vector potential formulation for the induction equation to maintain the zero divergence constraint for the magnetic field. The force-free formulation we adopt evolves the magnetic field and the Poynting vector, instead of the magnetic and electric fields. We show that our force-free code passes a robust suite of tests, performed both in 1D flat spacetime and in 3D black hole spacetimes. We also demonstrate that our matching technique successfully reproduces the aligned rotator force-free solution. Our new techniques are suitable for studying electromagnetic effects and predicting electromagnetic signals arising in many different curved spacetime scenarios. For example, we can treat spinning neutron stars, either in isolation or in compact binaries, that have MHD interiors and force-free magnetospheres.},

It is generally expected that orbiting bodies will lose energy in gravitational waves, slowly inspiralling into the black hole. Instead, we show that the coupling of the field to matter leads to a surprising effect: because of superradiance, matter can hover into "floating orbits" for which the net gravitational energy loss at infinity is entirely provided by the black hole's rotational energy. Orbiting bodies remain floating until they extract sufficient angular momentum from the black hole, or until perturbations or nonlinear effects disrupt the orbit. For slowly rotating and nonrotating black holes floating orbits are unlikely to exist, but resonances at orbital frequencies corresponding to quasibound states of the scalar field can speed up the inspiral, so that the orbiting body "sinks". These effects could be a smoking gun of deviations from general relativity.},

abstract = {When magnetic field lines thread a rotating black hole's horizon and connect with remote astrophysical loads, the rotational energy of the black hole can be extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Due to the rotation of the black hole, the magnetic field lines are twisted and toroidal components are generated. Thus, poloidal electric currents are induced and the black hole's rotational energy is transported to the astrophysical loads through Poynting flux. The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has been considered to be a possible process for powering extragalactic jets. In this Letter, we show that because of the screw instability of the magnetic field, the toroidal components of the magnetic field, and thus the poloidal currents, cannot exceed the limits given by the Kruskal-Shafranov criterion. This significantly lowers the power of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism when the loads are far from the black hole. So the Blandford-Znajek mechanism can only work efficiently within the neighborhood of the black hole. The implications of the results for the scenario of extragalactic jets powered by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism are discussed.},

The electromagnetic field occurring when a Kerr black hole is placed in an originally uniform magnetic field is derived without assuming the alignment of the direction of the magnetic field and the axis of symmetry of the black hole.},

abstract = {In this paper we report the results of axisymmetric relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for the problem of a Kerr black hole immersed in a rarefied plasma with `uniform' magnetic field. The long-term solution shows properties that are significantly different from those of the initial transient phase studied recently by Koide. The topology of magnetic field lines within the ergosphere is similar to that of the split-monopole model with a strong current sheet in the equatorial plane. Closer inspection reveals a system of isolated magnetic islands inside the sheet and ongoing magnetic reconnection. No regions of negative hydrodynamic `energy at infinity' are seen inside the ergosphere and the so-called MHD Penrose process does not operate. However, the rotational energy of the black hole continues to be extracted via the purely electromagnetic Blandford-Znajek mechanism. In spite of this, no strong relativistic outflows from the black hole are seen to be developing. Combined with results of other recent simulations, our results signal a potential problem for the standard MHD model of relativistic astrophysical jets should they be found at distances as small as a few tens of gravitational radii from the central black hole.},

abstract = {We present, for the first time, the structure of the axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotating magnetic dipole, in the case in which there exists a sufficiently large charge density (whose origin we do not question) to satisfy the ideal MHD condition, E\b.dot B=0, everywhere. The unique distribution of electric current along the open magnetic field lines that is required for the solution to be continuous and smooth is obtained numerically. With the geometry of the field lines thus determined, we compute the dynamics of the associated MHD wind. The main result is that the relativistic outflow contained in the magnetosphere is not accelerated to the extremely relativistic energies required for the flow to generate gamma rays. We expect that our solution will be useful as the starting point for detailed studies of pulsar magnetospheres under more general conditions, namely, when the force-free and/or the ideal MHD condition, E\b.dot B=0, are not valid in the entire magnetosphere. Based on our solution, we consider that the most likely positions of such an occurrence are the polar cap, the crossings of the zero space charge surface by open field lines, and the return current boundary, but not the light cylinder.},

The novelty of our approach is three-folded: i) We use the "multi-block" technique to represent a domain with $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}^{+}$ topology within a stable finite-differences scheme. ii) We employ as evolution equations those arising from a covariant hyperbolization of the FFE system. iii) We implement stable and constraint-preserving boundary conditions to represent an outer region given by a uniform magnetic field aligned or misaligned respect to the symmetry axis. We find stationary jet solutions which reach equilibrium --through boundary conditions-- with the outer numerical surface. This is so, even when the outer boundary is located very close to the central region (i.e. $r_{out}\sim 10M $). These numerical solutions reproduce most of the known results for analogue astrophysical settings.},

@article{Begelman1998,
abstract = {Astrophysical jets and pulsar-fed supernova remnants (plerions) are expected to develop highly organized magnetic structures dominated by concentric loops of toroidal field, B$\phi$. It has been argued that such structures could explain the polarization properties of some jets and contribute to their lateral confinement through magnetic tension forces. A concentric toroidal field geometry is also central to the Rees-Gunn model for the Crab Nebula, the archetypal plerion, and leads to the deduction that the Crab pulsar's wind must have a weak magnetic field. Yet this kind of equilibrium between magnetic and gas pressure forces, the ``equilibrium Z-pinch'' of the controlled fusion literature, is well known to be susceptible to disruptive localized instabilities, even when the magnetic field is weak and/or boundary conditions (e.g., a dense external medium) slow or suppress global modes. Thus, the magnetic field structures imputed to the interiors of jets and plerions are unlikely to persist for very long.  To determine the growth rates of Z-pinch instabilities under astrophysical conditions, I derive a dispersion relation that is valid for the relativistic fluids of which jets and plerions may be composed, in the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) limit. The dominant instabilities are kink (m = 1) and pinch (m = 0) modes. The former generally dominate, destroying the concentric field structure and probably driving the system toward a more chaotic state in which the mean field strength is independent of radius (and in which resistive dissipation of the field may be enhanced). I estimate the timescales over which the field structure is likely to be rearranged and relate these to distances along relativistic jets and radii from the central pulsar in a plerion.  I conclude that the central tenet of the Rees-Gunn model for the Crab Nebula, the existence of a concentric toroidal field well outside the pulsar wind's termination shock, is physically unrealistic. With this assumption gone, there is no dynamical reason to conclude that the magnetic energy flux carried by the pulsar wind is much weaker than the kinetic energy flux. Abandoning the principal conclusion of Rees & Gunn would resolve a long-standing puzzle in pulsar wind theory.},

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) require an engine capable of driving a jet of plasma to ultrarelativistic bulk Lorentz factors of up to several hundred and into narrow opening angles of a few degrees. We use global axisymmetric stationary solutions of magnetically-dominated (force-free) ultrarelativistic jets to test whether the popular magnetic-driving paradigm can generate the required Lorentz factors and opening angles. Our global solutions are obtained via time-dependent relativistic ideal magnetodynamical numerical simulations which follow the jet from the central engine to beyond six orders of magnitude in radius. Our model is primarily motivated by the collapsar model, in which a jet is produced by a spinning black hole or neutron star and then propagates through a massive stellar envelope. We find that the size of the presupernova progenitor star and the radial profile of pressure inside the star determine the terminal Lorentz factor and opening angle of the jet. At the radius where the jet breaks out of the star, our well-motivated fiducial model generates a Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 400$ and a half-opening angle $\theta_j\sim 2^\circ$, consistent with observations of many long-duration GRBs. Other models with slightly different parameters give $\gamma$ in the range 100 to 5000 and $\theta_j$ from $0.1^\circ$ to $10^\circ$, thus reproducing the range of properties inferred for GRB jets. A potentially observable feature of some of our solutions is that the maximum Poynting flux in the jet is found at $\theta \sim \theta_j$ with the jet power concentrated in a hollow cone, while the maximum in the Lorentz factor occurs at an angle $\theta$ substantially smaller than $\theta_j$ also in a hollow cone.

While the two functions $\Omega$ and $I$ are not arbitrarily given, which need to be self-consistently determined along with the differential equation. Based on the perturbation approach we proposed in paper I \citep{Pan2015a}, in this paper, we self-consistently sort out two boundary conditions governing $\Omega$ and $I$, and interpret these conditions mathematically and physically. Making use of the boundary conditions, we prove that all magnetic field lines crossing the infinite-redshift surface also penetrate the event horizon.

abstract = {General relativistic numerical simulations of magnetized accretion flows around black holes show a disordered electromagnetic structure in the disc and corona and a highly relativistic, Poynting-dominated funnel jet in the polar regions. The polar jet is nearly consistent with the stationary paraboloidal Blandford-Znajek model of an organized field threading the polar regions of a rotating black hole. How can a disordered accretion disc and corona lead to an ordered jet? We show that the polar jet is associated with a strikingly simple angular-integrated toroidal current distribution dI$\phi$/dr $\sim$ r-5/4, where I$\phi$(r) is the toroidal current enclosed inside radius r. We demonstrate that the poloidal magnetic field in the simulated jet agrees well with the force-free field solution for a non-rotating thin disc with an r-5/4 toroidal current, suggesting rotation leads to negligible self-collimation. We find that the polar field is confined/collimated by the corona. We also study the properties of the bulk of the simulated disc, which contains a turbulent magnetic field locked to the disc's Keplerian rotation except for rapidly rotating prograde black holes (a/M >$\sim$ 0.4) for which within r <$\sim$ 3GM/c2 the field locks to roughly half the black hole spin frequency. The electromagnetic field in the disc also scales as r-5/4, which is consistent with some Newtonian accretion models that assume rough equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure. However, the agreement is accidental since towards the black hole the magnetic pressure increases faster than the gas pressure. This field dominance near the black hole is associated with magnetic stresses that imply a large effective viscosity parameter $\alpha$ $\sim$ 1, whereas the typically assumed value of $\alpha$ $\sim$ 0.1 holds far from the black hole.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display a bimodal duration distribution, with a separation between the short- and long-duration bursts at about 2 sec. The progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae, their exclusive location in star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright ultraviolet regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (NS-NS or NS-BH). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005, provided the first insight into their energy scale and environments, established a cosmological origin, a mix of host galaxy types, and an absence of associated supernovae. In this review I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host galaxy observations, and use this information to shed light on the nature and properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors, although some open questions remain. Based on this association, observations of short GRBs and their afterglows can shed light on the on- and off-axis electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources from the Advanced LIGO/Virgo experiments.},

abstract = {The Grad--Shafranov approach to the problem of the structure of the black hole magnetosphere is discussed. For the double transonic flow, the number of boundary conditions in the pair creation region is shown to be sufficient to determine not only the longitudinal electric current, but also the angular velocity of a flow as a solution to a problem. As a result, the energy loss is determined by the physical parameters at the particle creation region rather than the ''boundary conditions'' at the event horizon. },

@article{McKinney2009a,
abstract = {Rotating magnetized compact objects and their accretion discs can generate strong toroidal magnetic fields driving highly magnetized plasmas into relativistic jets. Of significant concern, however, has been that a strong toroidal field in the jet should be highly unstable to the non-axisymmetric helical kink (screw) m = 1 mode leading to rapid disruption. In addition, a recent concern has been that the jet formation process itself may be unstable due to the accretion of non-dipolar magnetic fields. We describe large-scale fully three-dimensional global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rapidly rotating, accreting black holes producing jets. We study both the stability of the jet as it propagates and the stability of the jet formation process during accretion of dipolar and quadrupolar fields. For our dipolar model, despite strong non-axisymmetric disc turbulence, the jet reaches Lorentz factors of {$\Gamma$} \$\sim${} 10 with opening half-angle {\thetas}_{j} \$\sim${} 5{\deg} at 10^{3} gravitational radii without significant disruption or dissipation with only mild substructure dominated by the m = 1 mode. On the contrary, our quadrupolar model does not produce a steady relativistic ({$\Gamma$} {\gt}\$\sim${} 3) jet due to mass loading of the polar regions caused by unstable polar fields. Thus, if produced, relativistic jets are roughly stable structures and may reach up to external shocks with strong magnetic fields. We discuss the astrophysical implications of the accreted magnetic geometry playing such a significant role in relativistic jet formation, and outline avenues for future work.},

@article{East2018,
abstract = {We revisit the problem of a spinning black hole immersed in a uniformly magnetized plasma within the context of force-free electrodynamics. Such configurations have been found to relax to stationary jet-like solutions that are powered by the rotational energy of the black hole. We write down an analytic description for the jet solutions in the low black hole spin limit, and demonstrate that it provides a good approximation to the configurations found dynamically. For characterizing the magnetospheres of rapidly spinning black holes, we find that the current sheet which forms in the black hole ergosphere plays an essential role. We study the properties of the current sheet, and its importance in determining the jet solution and the rate at which energy is extracted from the black hole.},

abstract = {We present analytic force-free solutions modeling rotating stars and black holes immersed in the magnetic field of a thin disk that terminates at an inner radius. The solutions are exact in flat spacetime and approximate in Kerr spacetime. The compact object produces a conical jet whose properties carry information about its nature. For example, the jet from a star is surrounded by a current sheet, while that of a black hole is smooth. We compute an effective resistance in each case and compare to the canonical values used in circuit models of energy extraction. These solutions illustrate all of the basic features of the Blandford-Znajek process for energy extraction and jet formation in a clean setting.},

@article{Yu2011,
abstract = {Motivated by coronal mass ejection studies, we construct general relativistic models of a magnetar magnetosphere endowed with strong magnetic fields. The equilibrium states of the stationary, axisymmetric magnetic fields in the magnetar magnetosphere are obtained as solutions of the Grad-Shafranov equation in a Schwarzschild spacetime. To understand the magnetic energy buildup in the magnetar magnetosphere, a generalized magnetic virial theorem in the Schwarzschild metric is newly derived. We carefully address the question whether the magnetar magnetospheric magnetic field can build up sufficient magnetic energy to account for the work required to open up the magnetic field during magnetar giant flares. We point out the importance of the Aly-Sturrock constraint, which has been widely studied in solar corona mass ejections, as a reference state in understanding magnetar energy storage processes. We examine how the magnetic field can possess enough energy to overcome the Aly-Sturrock energy constraint and open up. In particular, general relativistic (GR) effects on the Aly-Sturrock energy constraint in the Schwarzschild spacetime are carefully investigated. It is found that, for magnetar outbursts, the Aly-Sturrock constraint is more stringent, i.e., the Aly-Sturrock energy threshold is enhanced due to the GR effects. In addition, neutron stars with greater mass have a higher Aly-Sturrock energy threshold and are more difficult to erupt. This indicates that magnetars are probably not neutron stars with extreme mass. For a typical neutron star with mass of $1-2 M_{{\o}dot}$, we further explore the effects of cross-field current effects, caused by the mass loading, on the possibility of stored magnetic field energy exceeding the Aly-Sturrock threshold.},
